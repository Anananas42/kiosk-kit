# Pi Emulator (QEMU)

QEMU-based Raspberry Pi emulator for pre-release validation. Boots a real Pi OS
image, provisions it with the production Ansible playbook, deploys and builds
the full kiosk stack, and runs smoke tests against the result.

The golden image includes the fully built kiosk application. On boot, the kiosk
server starts automatically via `kioskkit.service` and serves the kiosk UI at
`http://localhost:3001` (forwarded from QEMU guest port 3001).

Replaces the previous `dev/kiosk-sim/` mock approach with higher-fidelity
emulation using real systemd services, wpa_supplicant, and (optionally)
mac80211_hwsim for WiFi testing.

## Prerequisites

Install on your host machine:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install qemu-system-arm qemu-utils qemu-efi-aarch64 libguestfs-tools

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install qemu
# Note: libguestfs is not available via Homebrew. Use Docker or a Linux VM
# to run build-image.sh, then use run.sh/test.sh on macOS.
```

You also need Ansible installed (for provisioning):

```bash
pip install ansible
```

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Build the golden image (downloads Pi OS, provisions with Ansible, ~15-20 min)
./build-image.sh

# 2. Boot the emulator
./run.sh

# 3. Access the kiosk UI
open http://localhost:3001

# 4. SSH into it (in another terminal)
ssh -p 2222 pi@localhost

# 5. Run smoke tests (boots a fresh overlay and tests automatically)
./test.sh
```

**Why `virt` machine instead of `raspi3b`/`raspi4b`?**

The QEMU `raspi3b` machine has USB-based networking (slow, fragile) and
`raspi4b` support is new and buggy. The generic `aarch64 virt` machine provides
stable virtio networking, configurable RAM/CPU, and reliable SSH port
forwarding — everything needed for Ansible provisioning and testing.

The trade-off is needing the Debian arm64 kernel (which has virtio drivers)
instead of the stock Pi kernel. This is installed into the image during
`build-image.sh` via guestfish.

## Scripts

### `build-image.sh`

Downloads Pi OS Lite, patches it for QEMU virt (installs Debian arm64 kernel,
fixes fstab, enables SSH), boots it, runs the Ansible provisioning playbook,
deploys the kiosk application via `deploy.yml`, verifies the health endpoint,
then snapshots the disk as `golden.qcow2`.

```bash
./build-image.sh           # Build (skips if golden.qcow2 exists)
./build-image.sh --force   # Force rebuild
```

The golden image needs rebuilding when `deploy/pi/ansible/` or the kiosk
application source code changes.

### `run.sh`

Boots from a copy-on-write overlay on top of the golden image. The golden image
is never modified.

```bash
./run.sh              # Interactive (Ctrl-A X to quit)
./run.sh --bg         # Background (daemonize)
./run.sh --persist    # Keep overlay changes after shutdown
```

Environment variables:
- `PI_EMU_SSH_PORT` — SSH port on host (default: 2222)
- `PI_EMU_KIOSK_PORT` — Kiosk server port on host (default: 3001)
- `PI_EMU_RAM` — Guest RAM (default: 2G)
- `PI_EMU_CPUS` — Guest CPUs (default: 4)

### `test.sh`

Boots a fresh overlay and runs a smoke test suite covering:

- SSH connectivity and OS identification
- Kiosk user and app directory exist
- Node.js and pnpm available
- kioskkit.service enabled and healthy on port 3001
- Kiosk UI serves HTML
- wpa_supplicant installed, WiFi scripts deployed
- mac80211_hwsim WiFi simulation (if available)
- Firewall rules active
- SSH hardening applied

```bash
./test.sh              # Full run (boot + test + shutdown)
./test.sh --skip-boot  # Skip boot (QEMU already running)
```

## WiFi testing with mac80211_hwsim

The build script attempts to load `mac80211_hwsim` (a kernel module that
creates virtual WiFi interfaces). When available, this enables testing real
`wpa_supplicant` interactions without physical hardware.

The Debian arm64 kernel typically includes this module. If it's not available
in a particular kernel version, the tests gracefully skip WiFi-specific checks.

When loaded with `radios=2`, it creates two virtual WiFi interfaces (wlan0,
wlan1) that can communicate with each other — useful for testing scan, connect,
and forget operations against real `wpa_supplicant`.

## Golden image management

- `golden.qcow2` is gitignored (too large to commit)
- Rebuild when Ansible playbook changes: `./build-image.sh --force`
- The `.work/` directory contains intermediate files (downloaded image, UEFI
  firmware) and is also gitignored
